Disable Dashboard Access: Only admins can access the dashboard by default. Whitelist trusted users easily, quick setup, and secure.

== Description ==

Remove dashboard access to non-admin users and easily control who can access your WordPress dashboard with simple configuration. By default, only administrators are allowed, but you can now whitelist specific trusted users by username—perfect for developers, VAs, or contractors.

**Features include**:

- Whitelist specific users by username
- Session expiration controls (1-24 hours)
- Option to apply session timeout to administrators
- Custom redirect URL for blocked users
- Secure, validated, and sanitized settings
- Hide admin toolbar for non-authorized users
- Developer-friendly filters for advanced customization

**Why Choose Disable Dashboard Access?**

* **Maximum Protection**: Instantly block unauthorized users from accessing sensitive dashboard areas.
* **Effortless Whitelisting**: Grant dashboard access to trusted users (developers, VAs, contractors) without changing their roles. Just add their usernames!
* **Session Security**: Automatically log out users after a set period for bulletproof session management. Choose from multiple timeout intervals and apply to all users or just non-admins.
* **Custom Redirects**: Guide blocked users to a branded page or helpful resource instead of the generic homepage.
* **Zero Configuration Needed**: Works out of the box—only administrators can access the dashboard until you customize settings.

**Perfect For:**

* Website owners who want peace of mind
* Agencies and developers managing multiple sites
* Teams needing granular dashboard access
* Anyone serious about WordPress security

Protect your site, empower your workflow, and deliver a professional experience—all with one lightweight plugin.
